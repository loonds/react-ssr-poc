engine optimization (SEO).

## Features

- Server-side rendering of React components
- Bundling of client-side and server-side code with Webpack
- CSS styles integration with CSS Modules
- Data fetching on the server side
- Server-side routing with React Router
- Error handling during rendering
- SEO optimization with meta tags
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Deployment options and considerations
